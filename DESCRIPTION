Description: This is a statistical inference framework for GSEA based on FUNctioNal ELastic-net regression, which utilizes the temporal information based on functional principal component analysis (FPCA), and disentangles the effects of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net regression. It then performs hypothesis testing for gene sets by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations.
